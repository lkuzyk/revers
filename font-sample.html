<h1 class="Jaro">The Indispensable Tiger</h1>
<h2 class="Work+Sans">In the heart of a dense jungle, there lived a remarkable tiger known as Indispensable. Unlike other tigers, he possessed a unique gift: the ability to communicate with all creatures, big and small.</h2>

<p class="EB+Garamond">Indispensable was revered by the animals of the jungle, who sought his wisdom in times of need. From the mighty elephants to the smallest insects, they all turned to him for guidance. <br>One day, a great drought gripped the land, and the jungle's inhabitants faced a dire predicament. The rivers ran dry, and the once lush vegetation withered away.
<br><br>With his keen insight, Indispensable devised a plan to save his fellow creatures. He rallied the animals together, organizing them into teams to dig wells, gather food, and share resources.
<br><br>Through his leadership and compassion, Indispensable brought unity to the jungle. Together, they weathered the drought and emerged stronger than ever before.
<br><br>From that day forward, Indispensable was hailed as a hero, forever remembered for his selflessness and unwavering dedication to the well-being of all. And as the jungle thrived once more, his legend lived on, inspiring generations to come.</p>
